/**
 * Band 4 — the editorial mirror.
 *
 * `clockwise` is the mirror prop and never changes the aspect ratio. What it
 * mirrors depends on box-count parity: with an odd count (3, 5) it swaps
 * which side the hero sits on; with an even count (4, 6) the hero stays put
 * and only the tail reverses. Three boxes here, so flipping it moves the
 * prose from right to left — a zig-zag against the band above without
 * touching range or placement. Lever: flip clockwise.
 *
 * Line-less: no outline, no colour. Boxes exist only where copy sits. The
 * prose is a different length per width: the asset spec gives a word count
 * per slot per width, because a 3:2 hero is 816px at 1440 and 244px at 390.
