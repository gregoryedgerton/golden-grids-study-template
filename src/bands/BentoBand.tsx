/**
 * Band 5 — the bento: no breakpoint at all.
 *
 * Not every band needs a lever. When every slot holds a number or a glyph the
 * grid is already fluid: the type is sized in container-query units against
 * the slot, so range, placement and child order never change. This file does
 * not call useViewport.
 *
 * `color` is a hue walk from a base hex: the SMALLEST box sits nearest the
 * base colour and the hero furthest — 180° away, plus 15° per box past four —
 * with lightness spread 3% per box. Pick a base light enough that dark text
 * clears AA on every step; the text colour is set explicitly, not inherited.
