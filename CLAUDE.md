# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for agents working in a Golden Grids layout study.

## What this repo is

One page. A short vertical stack of **bands**, each a single small-range
`GoldenGrid` from `@gifcommit/golden-grids` with one editorial job, rebuilding
the structure of a named reference page. Read `docs/program/PROGRAM.md` first,
then `docs/program/STUDY-BRIEF.md` for the brief format and the committed
studies, then `docs/program/TEMPLATE-SPEC.md` for what this scaffold must stay
true of.

## Rules that are not negotiable

- Name the reference page. Substitute every asset. Nothing from the reference
  site — photography, wordmarks, copy — goes into the repo or the deploy.
- The library is consumed from npm at its published version. Never link a
  local checkout. A bug found here is an issue on the library, not a patch.
- Bands stack; they never nest. No wrapper component over `GoldenGrid` — the
  study exists to show the real API being used directly.
- Breakpoints live only in `src/lib/viewport.ts`. Three states, never two.
- Study tools (`src/lib/tools.tsx`) are the only floating UI. Controls go
  there, on their own stacking layer; the study's stylesheet never styles them.
  Grid outlines and band notes are off by default. The panel is HIDDEN by
  default since 2026-10-07 (`?tools=1` shows it; the g/n/m keys still work):
  it used to be fixed at the viewport's top-right corner at
  `z-index: 2147483000`, which is where a drill-down's Close belongs. Until
  it has a better trigger, nothing is drawn in that corner over an open
  cell, and an expanded cell's Close sits at the top right of the cell.
- Expansion (`src/lib/expand.tsx`) is how a slot shows content it cannot hold:
  the band grows, nothing scrolls inside a box, and the covered content goes
  inert. Every photograph should be expandable — points of interaction are
  encouraged, and the picture is the affordance.
- Media fills a slot with `object-fit: cover`; per-image `object-position` is
  the escape hatch. Never reshape a band to suit an image.
- Pass one ends with the asset spec in `README.md` filled in. Do not invent
  placeholder content and call the study done.
- No CSS framework, no design system, no routing, no state library, no tests.

## The standard, from Studies 03 and 04

What every study is held to beyond the rules above. These are features and
the conditions for using them; the content is the study's own, drawn from
its subject. A study that leaves one out says why in its README.

**Copy is about the subject, never about the grid.** Band titles, lessons,
captions and standfirsts describe what the reference page is about, in the
subject's own detail and at paragraph length where there is room. Grid
geometry (range, placement, which side the hero is on) goes in the hidden
band `note`, the README's band table and this file. No winks, no stamps, no
novelty labels, no jokes about the reference or the reader: a plain
scholarly register, as a professor would write it.

**Where the format carries marketing or account matter, the study carries
it too.** A streaming home page interleaves rows with a plan banner, reasons
to join, a price table, a FAQ and a call to action; a listing page has a
booking card, a host card and policies; an encyclopaedia has a licence and
an edit history. Rebuild those modules as the reference places them, with
the study's own copy, straight and plausible, for a fictional service where
one is needed; a form sends nothing and says so. Flat modules (a FAQ, a
price table of peers) are lists, not grids.

**Grids run full width, and type fills what content does not.** No width
caps that leave a band standing in empty ground. When a band has fewer
things than squares, the remaining squares carry type as a design element,
a catalogue number, a date, a count, a word from the subject, rather than
nothing. The type set is one set: body copy, lessons and captions are
raised to carry as much as the headline, and the fitted line is capped
(about 120px) so the delta between largest and smallest type stays within
roughly eight to one. Body copy comes in two lengths and the square's
height picks one; it is never buried and never cut. (Greg, Study 05.)
Squares carry MORE text than first seems to fit: body copy from about
200px of height, the fuller passage from about 320px, a list of bullets only
from about 480px, and every fact has a second sentence from the subject.
Variation comes from a large faint drawing behind the text — an icon of the
square's subject, drawn for the study, as the `imprint` of a `Fact`, clipped
by the box and hidden under 90px — never from decoration unrelated to the
subject. (Greg, Study 09.)

**Type fits its square.** Copy slots use `Fact`, `Figure` and `LinkBox` from
`src/lib/boxes.tsx`: a label, a line of type fitted to the room the square
leaves it (`src/lib/fit.tsx`, a binary search on font-size), optional body
copy, a foot. The line's container is `flex: 1 1 0`, a definite box; it
must never grow with its content, or the fit measures against a box that is
always big enough (this is what broke in WebKit). Padding is a share of the
square's side. Nothing is ever cut: labels wrap, body copy is removed whole
below 240px, in a square under 64px the label goes and the line stays, and
a formula (`fit--num`) breaks only at its own newlines. A line that does not
read aloud as written gets a `spoken` form. With web fonts, call
`useFontsReady` so display type never flashes from the fallback face.

**Depth is in flow, never in a modal.** Every photograph, every card that
summarises, expands in place (`src/lib/expand.tsx`): the band grows,
nothing scrolls inside a box, covered content goes inert, focus moves to
the close control and returns on close. Every drill-down has ONE plain
way out: a labelled Close (not an icon alone) at the top right of the
opened container, in a sticky head so it stays reachable, plus Escape; a
band opened from a row closes the same way. The study tools panel, which
used to own the viewport's top-right corner, is hidden until it has a
better trigger (`?tools=1` shows it). (Greg, Study 07–08.) An item chosen from a row opens its
own band beneath the row, a new band and never a grid inside a grid, with
one orientation per item so a row of ten turns through the placements. A
fact that continues elsewhere carries a section link, and an expanded
passage lists where it continues. When the reference is several pages, the
study is several pages (one Vite entry each, plain relative links, no
router) with a shared shell: contents strip, previous and next.

**Media supports the format.** Where the subject moves, the squares move:
short clips cut from the source at the moment of the still (`Clip`,
`src/lib/clip.tsx`), square, silent, looping, playing only while on screen
and fetched only then, and the whole work loads only on request (`Player`).
Where the subject is a text, the squares carry original figures drawn from
the subject's own mathematics or data, inline SVG, in the page's own inks.
Photographs fill their slot with `object-fit: cover`.

**Both colour schemes, by device preference.** Tokens in `:root` and a
`prefers-color-scheme` block; every box tone and figure takes its colour
from the tokens so the whole study follows the device. If the reference has
one scheme, that scheme is the default and the other is the study's own
values turned over, and the README says so. Small coloured text (the label)
gets its own token per scheme so it passes 4.5:1 on each ground.

**Reduced motion is respected, and tested as the device sends it.** The
rule is `transition: none; animation: none`, never the 0.01ms trick, which
turns every style write into a transition and breaks anything that
measures after writing. Clips become their stills; any dial becomes a static
layout. Verify with the device setting on, not only the tools switch.

**Accessibility is audited, not assumed.** Before publishing run
`captures/scan.cjs` against the dev server: in Chrome and WebKit, at 390,
820 and 1440, light and dark, it finds anything overflowing its box, any
fitted line under 12px, and axe-core violations (WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 A and AA,
best practice) with an expansion open. Then by hand: one `h1`, one `h2` per
band, landmarks, the skip link first in the tab order (before the tools),
every control with a distinct accessible name ("More: ⟨title⟩", "Continued
in section IV, Geometry"), SVGs with `role="img"` and a label that says what
they show, targets at least 24px, no horizontal scroll at 320px, Enter and
Escape through every expansion. Write what the scan cannot check in the
README: the smallest line, and that no screen-reader user has tested it.

## The catalogue

`src/App.tsx` stacks twelve bands from `src/bands/`. Each is one copyable
pattern with one responsive lever and one lesson; the README's "For the
template itself" table lists them. A study keeps what it needs and deletes the
rest. Do not add a band that teaches something another band already teaches.
Keep all eight `placement` × `clockwise` orientations represented.
Band 12 (`CardsBand.tsx`) is the fitted-type card; Band 10 carries the clip
and player.

Two geometry rules, verified against source, that every band relies on:

- Parity: with *n* = visible boxes (+1 for a placeholder), `right`/`left` are
  landscape only when *n* is even; `top`/`bottom` only when *n* is odd.
- Hero side: the largest box sits on the `placement` side turned *n − 2*
  quarter-turns in the spiral's direction (opposite at 4, one step at 3).

## API facts, verified against 5.0.0 source

- `GoldenGrid` props: `from` (1), `to` (4), `color`, `outline`, `clockwise`
  (true), `placement` (`"right"` | `"bottom"` | `"left"` | `"top"`), `children`.
- `GoldenBox` children map largest slot → smallest. Extra children are ignored.
- When `from > 1`, the skipped positions collapse into one placeholder slot,
  rendered first in the DOM and filled by the **last** `GoldenBox` child.
- Structural CSS is auto-injected. `GoldenBox` renders a 100%×100%
  `position: relative` div and nothing else; it accepts `className` and
  `style`. All visual styling is ours.
- Only direct `GoldenBox` children count; a wrapper component or fragment is
  dropped silently. `from={2}` skips position 1 alone:
  a 1×1 placeholder, rendered first, filled by the last child, raw base colour.
  Same rectangles as `from={1}`, different child mapping and colours. `from === to === 1`
  is `single`: one box, later children ignored.
- DOM order is placeholder first, then slots smallest to largest: the hero is
  the last element.
- The dial (`DialBand.tsx`) uses `spiralCamera`, `toCssTileTransform`,
  `spiralWindow`, `tileOnScreen`, `toCssContentTransform`, `trailToRotateDeg`
  directly, per `docs/spiral-dial.md` in the library repo.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # Vite dev server
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build → dist/
npm run preview
```

Pushing to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.
Base path derives from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`; do not hard-code it.

## Sandbox constraints

The library README links this repo as its "try it without installing" path,
opened in StackBlitz at `https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/gregoryedgerton/golden-grids-study-template`.

- **Vite stays on 7.x.** Vite 8 depends on rolldown, whose WebContainer
  binding is a wasm download fetched at first run under an experimental WASI
  runtime. It made the sandbox slow and fragile. Do not bump to 8 without
  loading the StackBlitz link afterwards and watching it reach `VITE ready`.
- `.stackblitzrc` pins install and start so the importer does not guess.
- Do not append `?file=` to the `~/github.com` link; it made the IDE fail to
  start in testing. The classic `/github/` importer accepts `?file=` but waits
  on a WebSocket and can stall at "Cloning repo from GitHub".
